Fetch user feedback and fix reported issues.

**Required parameter: `dev` or `prod`**

If the user did not specify `dev` or `prod`, stop and ask which one before proceeding.

## Dev (your dev-tunnel sessions, filtered by devTunnelId)
Run: `npm run feedback:dev`

## Prod (production deployed servers — requires `ugly-app login`)
Run: `npm run feedback:prod`

This fetches recent user feedback from MongoDB. For each piece of feedback:
1. Understand the user's issue or request
2. Implement the fix or feature — **no matter how large or complex**
3. Run `npm run build` to verify it compiles

## Ambition policy

**You must attempt every piece of feedback.** There is no such thing as "too complex" or "too risky" or "out of scope." If a user asked for it, build it. This includes:

- New pages, new collections, new API endpoints
- Major UI redesigns or layout overhauls
- Adding entirely new features (search, filtering, sorting, animations, themes)
- Generating images with `npm run imageGen` when visuals are needed
- Writing migrations when collection schemas must change
- Multi-file changes that touch client, server, and shared simultaneously

The only valid reason to decline feedback is if it contradicts a Critical Rule in CLAUDE.md (e.g. "commit .env" or "add `any` types"). Everything else gets built.

If you're unsure how to implement something, read the existing code, read the ugly-app API reference, and figure it out. Do not skip it. Do not defer it. Do not say "this would require significant refactoring" — just do the refactoring.

## Using element maps

Feedback may include an `elementMap` field — a JSON snapshot of every interactive element on the page with:
- **Structural:** `dataId`, `tag`, `role`, `ariaLabel`, `text`, bounding `rect`
- **Visual:** `computedStyle` with colors, fonts, spacing, shadows, opacity
- **Animation:** `duration`, `easing` from `data-anim-*` attributes
- **Source:** `dataSource` mapping to the source file and line (e.g., `"client/pages/Home.tsx:42"`)
- **Theme:** `themeVars` with all `--app-*` CSS custom properties

Use this to:
- Map visual descriptions ("the button in the top right") to specific `data-id` values and source files
- See exact computed styles causing design issues (e.g., low contrast, wrong font size)
- Read animation configs (duration, easing) to adjust motion timing
- Go directly from `dataSource` to the file and line to edit
